# 🩺 AI-Powered Kidney Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based diagnostic system to classify **CT kidney scans** into four categories:  
- 🟢 Normal  
- 🟡 Cyst  
- 🔴 Stone  
- 🟣 Tumor  

The model leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on CT images to assist in **early detection of kidney disorders**, supporting doctors in preventive healthcare and faster decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features
- End-to-end pipeline for **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.  
- CNN-based architecture for accurate **kidney disease classification**.  
- Achieved **~95–99% validation accuracy**.  
- Clear visualizations of **training loss, accuracy, and predictions**.  
- Scalable design for integration into **healthcare applications**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains **CT scan images of kidneys** divided into four classes:  

### 🔹 Sample Images
| Normal | Stone | Tumor |
|--------|-------|-------|
| ![Normal](data_samples/normal.png) | ![Stone](data_samples/stone.png) | ![Tumor](data_samples/tumor.png) |
